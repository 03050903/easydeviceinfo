# Usage Docs/Wiki

Introducing **Mods** in **EasyDeviceInfo v2.0.0**!

***Mods*** or *Modules* are the new way to retrieve information. They let you get information in a very segmented manner and the best part is you only initialize the Mods you need in your project. Pretty rad , eh ?  I know. 

The whole api has been reworked however the functions remain the same, hence now you need to migrate to v2.x.x from 1.x.x. 

Checkout the new way to use the API in [Wiki](https://github.com/nisrulz/easydeviceinfo/wiki)

# Pull Requests
I welcome and encourage all pull requests. It usually will take me within 24-48 hours to respond to any issue or request. Here are some basic rules to follow to ensure timely addition of your request:
  1. Match coding style (braces, spacing, etc.) This is best achieved using `CMD`+`Option`+`L` (Reformat code) on Mac (not sure for Windows) with Android Studio defaults.
  2. If its a feature, bugfix, or anything please only change code to what you specify.
  3. Please keep PR titles easy to read and descriptive of changes, this will make them easier to merge :)
  4. Pull requests _must_ be made against `develop` branch. Any other branch (unless specified by the maintainers) will get rejected.
  5. Check for existing [issues](https://github.com/nisrulz/easydeviceinfo/issues) first, before filing an issue.  
  6. Have fun!
